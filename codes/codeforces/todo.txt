scc-427C
bridges-uva 796
articulation points-uva 10199
dsu-400D

condition for bridges:-
	id[from]<low[to] => (from,to) is bridge
condition for articulation points:
	(source node) => number of children>1 => source is A.P.
	(non source node) => id[from]<=low[to] => from is A.P.
idea for scc(tarjans):-
	update lowlink value of a node using only those children who are on the "stack".
	if id[curr]==low[curr] => a SCC is found with lowlink values of all nodes in this SCC equal to id[curr].
	unlike bridges and A.P. parent of a node is not required in dfs in tarjans algo.
